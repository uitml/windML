###WP1: Analysis of a sensor network recording weather data over Norway. 

The goal of the WP1 is to analyze weather data collected all over Norway by a network of sensors. We seek to understand the behavior of weather variables, in particular the wind and their correlation in different place of Norway. Network science and machine learning methods will be used to find interesting places for the implantation of future windmills.
