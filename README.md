# Machine Learning for wind prediction and modelling

This repository contains the code of our project for predicting and modelling wind using machine learning. 

In the folder `2023` is the work done in 2023 for extracting data from seklima (measurement stations) and CARRA (re-analysis data) datasets.

In the folder `2024` is the work done on 
1) collecting CARRA data and SAR images around the Goliath offshore station,
2) training Graph Neural Networks to model the wind speed using these data.

More information is available in the README file within each folder.
